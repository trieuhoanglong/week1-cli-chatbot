# Week 1 â€” RAG Chatbot with Streamlit

## ðŸ“Œ What is it?
This is a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** chatbot built with **Streamlit**, **LangChain**, and **OpenAI**.  
It allows you to upload a **PDF file**, converts it into **embeddings** stored in a **FAISS vector database**, and then uses an OpenAI model to answer your questions **based only on your document**.

**Why itâ€™s cool:**  
- Uses the same concept as production-grade AI search systems.
